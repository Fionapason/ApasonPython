"""
These classes define all the Arduino control instruments
They take their parameters from the configurations files
They are then all initialized in the Arduino_Control_Instruments class

Each instance of a type of control instrument has a unique ID, taken from the configurations file.

Also, each class instance has the ID of the arduino it's plugged into as a class member,
also taken from the configurations file.

The digitally set classes (CV3, OCV, and Polarity) simply have the necessary commands as class members.

Pump objects can additionally set analog voltages, using the function find_voltage(wanted_value),
which returns the int from 0-4095 that needs to be set to attain the wanted_value.
This also has its respective DAC output as a member, also set in the configurations file.

THE ARDUINO_CONTROL_INSTRUMENTS OBJECTS ARE NOT *SUPPOSED* TO INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH THE ARDUINO!

THE ARDUINO_UTILITIES CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS,
AND SIMPLY USES CLASS MEMBERS FROM HERE TO GET THE NECESSARY INFO
